ANESTHESIA\
Assumptions:\
The EEG data is stored in EDF files (European Data Format).\
You have access to Python libraries like MNE, scipy, pandas, numpy, sklearn, and pycatch22.\
Your dataset contains the necessary metadata, such as mentation categories and EEG features.\
Functions:\
1. Load and preprocess EEG data.\
2. Extract features (PSD, Catch22, etc.) from the EEG.\
3. Train classifiers (e.g., Random Forest, SVM) to predict mentation states (active/inactive).\
4. Generate automated anesthesia scores and perform analyses on the relationship between anesthesia depth and mentation states.
